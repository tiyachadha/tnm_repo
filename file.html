        <h1>Happy 5-Month Anniversary!</h1>
        <p>My Dearest Tanmay,</p>
        <p>
            It's hard to believe that three months have already passed since we started this amazing journey together. Every moment with you has been nothing short of magical, and I am constantly reminded of how lucky I am to have you in my life.
        </p>
        <p>
            Your kindness, your smile, and the way you make everything better just by being there have made these past three months the best time of my life. I cherish every memory we've made and look forward to creating many more together.
        </p>
        <p>
            Thank you for being my rock, my confidant, and my best friend. I love you more with each passing day, and I am so excited for all the adventures that lie ahead for us.
        </p>
        <p class="signature">
            With all my love,<br>
            [Your Name] <span class="heart">&hearts;</span>
